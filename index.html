                        Oversimplifying a bit, her talk was about programming abstractions from a teaching perspective. We create abstractions of bigger, more complicated concepts, and we use those abstractions to match patterns. When we teach beginners, we need to be careful about which abstractions we collectively use, because ultimately those matched patterns have consequences. Sometimes the way our abstractions were developed makes it extremely hard to figure out what purpose they originally served. For beginners, and for us as teachers.

Basically what that means is that the AI interface is given a body, a face, and uses that to communicate nonverbally alongside methods like text or voice. Sometimes that means a physical robot.</aside>

                        From "The High Cost of Free Office Snacks": "Technology companies are famous for providing free food for their employees. Office areas stocked with snacks are great for morale and promote random interactions that often generate new ideas.  The problem is that free food, if it’s the wrong kind, is not really free. It can kill you — or at least make you fat and unhealthy." In the opening of this article, ideas are generated by snacks, and snacks can kill you; tech employees are somehow involved. Not those employees, but you, the reader, you specifically are implicated, and if your body is fat, the meaning that your embodiment is conveying is apparently sickness and death.

                        For that matter, what cultural assumptions do we make when we decide which foods are good or bad? Where does it have to come from? How much does it have to cost? What foods don't make the cut? And who are we willing to displace to remake the world we think we want?

                        There is so much material on colonialism and white supremancy from the earliest days of nutritional studies that we have abstracted away from their origins but are still fully present in the way we talk about bodies and food. I did not give myself enough time to even scratch the surface of the ways that we oppress people using tools like food and exercise. I'm including some recommended reading in this slide to try to make it up to you.

                        People use fat talk as a way to test people’s perceptions, to get reassurance, to get confirmation of suspicions, or to evaluate socially upward trajectories. Fat talk can be a means of absolution. Sometimes it can be a way to gain control by saying something bad about yourself before someone else does. It can be a way that we share what scares us.

                        Fat talk is conversational. There is practically a set script. When someone says “I wish I was thinner”, we know what’s supposed to be said next. “Me too.” Or: “Nah, you look great.” Someone says “Ugh, I need to start going to the gym. I’m so weak,” is supposed to be followed by, “Yeah, I’m totally out of shape.” Or: “Yeah, but at least you had that salad.” When other people fat talk, we feel pressured to engage. Even if we feel awesome or indifferent.

                        Arroyo and Harwood found that fat talk is a mediator. Fat talk is what exists in between weight thoughts and mental health concerns, between chronic dieting and the possibility of an eating disorder. A good day and a bad one. Fat talk, whether reinforced or shut down, negotiates the way forward for vulnerable populations. Even when you aren’t the one initiating it.

                        When we talk about eating disorders, those vulnerable populations are often assumed to be women. Usually white women, and usually those with the means to seek treatment in the first place. Research demographics (and tech diversity measures) unfortunately rarely deviate from that expectation. The everyday assumption with eating disorders is also usually that we’re talking about anorexia or bulimia.
